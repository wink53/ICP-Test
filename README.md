# ICP Project

## Environment Constraints
- **No local `dfx` server**: We do not run `dfx start` or `dfx deploy` locally.
- **ICP Ninja**: Testing and compilation are done via [ICP Ninja](https://icp.ninja) (or similar browser-based IDEs).
- **Local Editing**: We write files locally and then move them to the browser for testing.
